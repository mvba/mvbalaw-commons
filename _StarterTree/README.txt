This is a starter project tree in the spirit of the TreeSurgeon application that Mike Roberts created and discussed on his blog (http://www.mikebroberts.com/blogtastic/archives/29).  The current version of TreeSurgeon is maintained by Bil Simser on Codeplex (http://treesurgeon.codeplex.com/).

However, while I liked the project structure of TreeSurgeon, I want to use Rake instead of NAnt and wanted more control than the generated project tree from TreeSurgeon.  Eventually, I would like to turn this into a T4 Template for use in Visual Studio.  For now, it is just a project tree that I can copy and paste whenever I want to start something new.  I took the Rake script from FubuMvc (http://code.google.com/p/fubumvc/).

Enjoy,
