This is a starter project tree in the spirit of the TreeSurgeon application that Mike Roberts created and discussed on his blog (http://www.mikebroberts.com/blogtastic/archives/29).  The current version of TreeSurgeon is maintained by Bil Simser on Codeplex (http://treesurgeon.codeplex.com/).

However, while I liked the project structure of TreeSurgeon, I want to use Rake instead of NAnt and wanted more control than the generated project tree from TreeSurgeon.  Eventually, I would like to turn this into a T4 Template for use in Visual Studio.  For now, it is just a project tree that I can copy and paste whenever I want to start something new.  I took the Rake script from FubuMvc (http://code.google.com/p/fubumvc/).

In order to build the project, you must have Rake and Ruby installed.  You can get Ruby from the Ruby Language web site.  I downloaded the Ruby 1.8.6 One-Click Installer from a link the Download Ruby page (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).  The file that I downloaded was ruby186-27_rc2.exe and it is available directly from http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/47082/ruby186-27_rc2.exe

Once Ruby is installed, run the InstallGems.bat file from the root of this directory to install Rake and its dependencies.

Enjoy,
Weston
